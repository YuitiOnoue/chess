# Java Chess Practice Project

Welcome to this my  Java Chess Practice Project! This project is designed to help me pratice Java, Git version control, gain basic knowledge of WSL, and get familiar with JUnit testing.

As a chess enthusiast, I've chosen to build a chess game to make the learning experience fun!

## Introduction

This project is aimed to practice skills in three key areas:

1. **Java Good Practices**: I'll try to use best practices in Java programming, such as code style, object orientation, design patterns, and efficient coding techniques.

2. **Git Version Control**: The project will serve as a platform to practice using Git for version control, enhancing my knowledge of branch management, pull requests, collaboration, and other essential GitHub features.

3. **JUnit tests**: I'll practice using JUnit to validate the functionality of your chess game, ensuring that it works correctly.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to develop a text-based chess game that can be played in the console. Players will input algebraic notations to make their moves. Here are the key components and milestones:

   Create a text-based menu for user interaction.
   Implement a chessboard visualization in the console.
   Parse chess algebraic notations provided by players.
   Validate the notations to ensure they represent valid moves.
   Implement the rules for each type of chess piece.
   Develop unit tests to verify the functionality of your chess game.
